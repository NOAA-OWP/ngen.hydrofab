# ngen.hydrofab: Fabricating Hydrofabrics for use with NextGen <img src='man/figures/imgfile.png' align="right" height="139" />

The goal of `ngen.hydrofab` is to provide consistent hydrologic and hydraulic network manipulation tool chains to build nextgen ready hydrofabric products.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library('hydrofab')
library('ngen.hydrofab')
library('glue')

base = '/Volumes/Transcend/ngen/CONUS-hydrofabric/'
VPU = "01"

outfile = glue("{base}nextgen/nextgen_{VPU}.gpkg")


# Read Uniform Hydrofabrci for VPU 01 and apply nexus toplogy, build crosswalk ect
ngen = get_hydrofabric(VPU = VPU, 
                        type = "uniform",
                        dir = glue("{base}uniform"),
                        overwrite = FALSE) %>% 
  apply_nexus_topology()

# Add flowpath attributes fro routing
ngen$flowpath_attributes <-  length_average_routelink(flowpaths = ngen$flowpaths,
                                                     rl_path = get_routelink_path())

# Write all layers to gpkg, add CFE and NOAHOWP attributes, then add AORC weight map
write_hydrofabric(ngen, outfile) %>% 
  aggregate_cfe_noahowp(dir  = '/Volumes/Transcend/nwmCONUS-v216/',
                          add_to_gpkg         = TRUE,
                          add_weights_to_gpkg = TRUE,
                          log                 = TRUE) %>% 
  add_grid_mapping(gpkg      = outfile,
                   template  = "./AORC-OWP_2012063021z.nc4",
                   grid_name = "aorc_weights",
                   log       = TRUE)}
```

```{r}
# See what was built
sf::st_layers(outfile)
```

Nextgen is not yet ready to leverage geopackage files so each layer of the geopackage is exported as a 
geojson, json, or csv depending on datatype:
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
write_ngen_dir(gpkg = outfile, dir = glue("{base}nextgen/nextgen_{VPU}"))
```


```{r}
#See what was made:
fs::dir_tree(dir)
```
